# FandianPF Cucumber feature backlog

This directory contains a collection of Cucumber features which have 
not yet been accepted for a given sprint.

This collection of features represents desired features/goals together 
with their testable scenarios which collectively describe the project. 

As such, this collection of Cucumber feature files, will grow as new 
goals are identified and shrink as these features get selected to be 
implemented in one or more sprints.

Once a given feature is selected for a given sprint, the feature file 
will be moved to an appropriate subdirectory of the features directory.

The features contained in this backlog are **NOT** expected to be 
complete Cucumber features. 

In particular they will rarely contain any associated step definitions. 

Completing these step definitions represents the first part of any 
given sprint. 

Typically this will be done during or just before the sprint plan is 
formalise.

However each feature file should contain:

 * a good high-level description, 
 * a "story", of what that feature should do
 * together with some justification as to why doing it is important.

Each story should contain:

 * what will happen (the action),
 * who will be doing the action,
 * who will want the action to happen,
 * what "business value" will be achieved by doing the action.
