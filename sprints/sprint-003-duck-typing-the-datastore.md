# Sprint 003 Semi-structured JSON content and duck-typing the Datastore

 * Started: 2013/07/30 Tuesday
 * Ends: 2013/08/09 Friday

## Tasks

 1. Understand how to manage overlapping hierarchical classifications 
of "duck-typed" content.

## Cucumber features

None at the moment.

## RSpec specifications

None at the moment.

## Questions and Risks

### Duck-typing vs Rigid-typing

**Problem:** We explicitly want to work with semi-structured (JSON 
based) content. Inevitably such semi-structured content will not lie in 
nicely distinct hierarchical classes.

In particular, different users will inevitably want to see the same 
item of content in differing ways, as different "duck-types".

On the other hand we as humans have a strong need for hierarchical 
classifications, so that we can manage the cognitive overload of 
simple heaps of things.

How do we manage this overlapping hierarchical structure?

## Wrap-up

Nothing at the moment.
