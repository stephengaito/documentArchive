## Questions and Risks

### Duck-typing vs Rigid-typing

**Problem:** We explicitly want to work with semi-structured (JSON 
based) content. Inevitably such semi-structured content will not lie in 
nicely distinct hierarchical classes.

In particular, different users will inevitably want to see the same 
item of content in differing ways, as different "duck-types".

On the other hand we as humans have a strong need for hierarchical 
classifications, so that we can manage the cognitive overload of 
simple heaps of things.

How do we manage this overlapping hierarchical structure?
