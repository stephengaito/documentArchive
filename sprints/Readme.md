# Overview of sprint planning process.

We work in 
[sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#Sprint) of 
multiples of single weeks (depending upon how difficult the next most 
important story turns out to be).

We use one or more files in the backlog directory to collect our 
current collection of potential Cucumber features.

For each sprint we move one or more Cucumber feature from our backlog 
to an appropriate subdirectory of the features directory.

For each sprint we have one file (in Markdown format) which records the 
feature titles to be tackled in that sprint, together with some 
overview of the difficulty or risks anticipated or observed.

Since we are using Behaviour Driven Development using Cucumber/RSpec, 
each story is developed into one or more Cucumber features (located in 
the features directory). Each sprint file records the Cucumber features 
worked on during that sprint.

While working on a given Cucumber feature we will need to write a 
number of RSpec specifications (located in the specs directory).  Each 
sprint file will also record the RSpec specifications worked on during 
that sprint.
