# Design considerations for JoyLoL 

We follow a task based test first development system. 

The file [TopTasks](TopTasks.md) provides an ordered list of our current 
top tasks and associated risks. 

The file [ToDo](ToDo.md) lists future tasks to consider (in no particular 
order) 

The file [Done](Done.md) lists past tasks which have been completed (with 
the most recently completed tasks listed first). 

The directory [tasks](tasks) contains any discussion of the goals, risks 
and subtasks for any given task.
