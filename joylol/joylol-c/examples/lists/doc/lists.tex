\chapter[title=Lists]

We explore the use of \joylol\ to provided packed lists, aka arrays. 

How do we show two coalgebras to be bisimilar?

We need to define:

\startitemize

\item \bold{joylolNatural} need to define natural numbers object. Then 
provide recursive definitions of addition and multiplication. Then 
translations from strings in various bases. 

\item \bold{bytesNatural} need to define natural numbers object. Then 
provid recursive definitions of addition and multiplication. Then 
translation from strings in various bases. 

\item \bold{gmpNatural} need to define natural numbers object. Then 
provide recursive definitions of addition and multiplication. Then 
translation from strings in various bases. 

\item \bold{byte} (or \bold{uint8})

\item \bold{uint64}

\item \bold{int64}

\item \bold{lists}

\item \bold{array}
