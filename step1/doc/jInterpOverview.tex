\section[title=Overview]

\joylolMinus\ is the most minimal \joylol\ compiler/interpreter hand coded 
in ANSI-C. 

Its only purpose is to run jPeg \quote{programs}, hence we specialize the 
overall \joylol\ structure, principally \quote{\type{context}}s}, to focus 
upon making jPeg programs run reasonably performantly. Any \joylol\ 
program which \quote{keeps} a given finite number of structures on top of 
the data stack, can be \quote{assisted} by adding the same structures are 
\quote{registers} of a modified \quote{\type{context}}. We do exactly this 
for this most minimal \joylol.
