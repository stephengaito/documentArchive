% Plato's universe

As every self respecting Computer Scientist knows, Plato's universe does not
consist of a collection of ``Sets'' but rather a ``collection'' of Lists of
Lists.

``Before the Set, was the List''

\begin{bnf*}
 \bnfProd{List}{ ( \bnfSP ) }
 \bnfAlt{ ( \bnfSP \bnfPN{List} \bnfSP \bnfTD{.} \bnfSP \bnfPN{List} \bnfSP )}
\end{bnf*}

Alternatively in Kleene star format as essentially used in Lisp/Scheme:

\begin{bnf*}
 \bnfProd{List}{ ( \bnfSP \bnfKS{ \bnfPN{List} }{*} \bnfSP ) }
\end{bnf*}

\begin{racket}
(println "Hello from Plato's universe!")
\end{racket}
