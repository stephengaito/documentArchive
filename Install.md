# Installation instructions

Alas, none at the moment....

## Requirements

1. The [luaMakeSystem](https://github.com/stephengaito/luaMakeSystem) is 
used to control the [ConTeXt](http://www.contextgarden.net/)'ing as well 
as building of all artefacts. 

2. The 
[literateProgrammingInConTeXt](https://github.com/stephengaito/literateProgrammingInConTeXt) 
is a [ConTeXt](http://www.contextgarden.net/) module used to embed all 
JoyLoL code inside a literate [ConTeXt](http://www.contextgarden.net/) 
document. 

3. The 
[diSimplexConTeXt](https://github.com/stephengaito/diSimplexConTeXt) is a 
[ConTeXt](http://www.contextgarden.net/) module used to provide a 
consitent formating and bibliographic tools for all DiSimplcial projects 
(of which JoyLoL is an integral part). 

4. The [commDiagConTeXt](https://github.com/stephengaito/commDiagConTeXt) 
is a [ConTeXt](http://www.contextgarden.net/) module used to draw 
commutative mathematical diagrams. JoyLoL is integrally about [Category 
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) (see also 
[nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory)), and hence is often 
best described using commutative diagrams. 

5. The [ConTests](https://github.com/stephengaito/ConTests) is a 
[ConTeXt](http://www.contextgarden.net/) module used to test all 
[literateProgrammingInConTeXt](https://github.com/stephengaito/literateProgrammingInConTeXt) 
based code. 

## Uses of JoyLoL 

1. The first and most important *use* of JoyLoL is as the basis of a 
(computational) implementation of Hilbert's Program,
[hilbertsProgram](https://github.com/stephengaito/hilbertsProgram).
