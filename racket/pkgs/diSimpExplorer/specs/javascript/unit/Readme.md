# diSimpExplorer (javascript) unit specifications

This directory collects the unit specifications for the javascript 
implementation of the diSimpExplorer [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/) 
browser controls.

**Unit testing** tests our code at the finest levels, is of primary 
interest only to the programmers, tests only single functions or objects, 
and generally run quickly (so can be run often).

**Unit tests should run quickly and often to catch problems as soon as 
possible.**

We use the [Jasmine.js
v2.4](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html)
[BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)
framework.
