# diSimpExplorer specification workspace

Each user of the diSimpExplorer tool will have at least one workspace, 
potentially many more as each workspace contains a coherent draft of 
"mathematics".

This particular workspace is used for the specification testing of the 
browser frontend of the diSimpExplorer tool.
