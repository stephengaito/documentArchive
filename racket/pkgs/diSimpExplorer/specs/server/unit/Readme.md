# diSimpExplorer (racket) unit specifications

This directory collects the unit specifications for the racket 
implementation of the diSimpExplorer [Racket 
web-application](https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/).

**Unit testing** tests our code at the finest levels, is of primary 
interest only to the programmers, tests only single functions or objects, 
and generally run quickly (so can be run often).

**Unit tests should run quickly and often to catch problems as soon as 
possible.**

We use the [RackUnit](http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/) testing
framework.
