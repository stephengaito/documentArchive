# External Vendor dependencies.

This directory contains the external vendor dependencies required for the 
diSimpExplorer project.

All of the node.js/npm based dependencies are managed by the 
packages.json file.

To install or update these dependencies simply type:

> npm install 

# Zepto.js

The Zepto.js dependency is managed differently. The easiest way to deal 
with this is by cloning the [gitHub 
project](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) itself. To do this simply type:

> git clone https://github.com/madrobby/zepto.git
