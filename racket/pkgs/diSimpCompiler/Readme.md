# DiSimplicial (cross) Compiler

This is a command line tool designed to (cross) compile a collection of 
theorems and their associated proofs in a given mathematical language.

If this command succeeds, then the proofs have been verified as correct 
for the given mathematical language.

If this command succeeds and a specific language interpretation has 
been provided, then the theorems and their associated proofs are cross 
compiled into the interpretation language.
