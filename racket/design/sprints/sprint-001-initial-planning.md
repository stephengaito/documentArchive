# Sprint 001 initial planning

* Started: 2016/05/09
* Ends: 2016/05/13 Friday

## Tasks

* Be able to specify a language syntax
 * Be able to specify a language syntax
 * Be able to specify language axioms

* Build a simple tool to read a BNF and compile it into a collection of 
  Racket structures.

* Load a language artefact

* Be able to write out a simple computational "proof"

* Rudimentary verification of a simple "proof"

All of the above are to be as simple as possible using flat Racket/text files.

## Features

## Specifications

## Questions and Risks

* Need to agree/document file formats for
 * language syntax
 * language axioms
 * computational "proofs"

* How are these files formats "implemented"/recognised/interpreted in the 
tool set?

* How are the persistent forms of the above file formats organised?

## Resources

* [Racket documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/)

## Wrap-up

Nothing at the moment
