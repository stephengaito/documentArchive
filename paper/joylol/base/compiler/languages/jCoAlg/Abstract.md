## Implementing the (base) JoyLoL CoAlgebra Language

In this document we implement the concrete CoAlgebras which define the 
(base) JoyLoL CoAlgebra Language.

This CoAlgeba language defines the CoAlgebraic structures which "contain" 
all of the other sublanguages. This CoAlgebra language takes care of the 
explicit definition of the "global" properties of a CoAlgebra such as 
inheritance, invariants, as well as the structure of the creation and 
feature methods.
