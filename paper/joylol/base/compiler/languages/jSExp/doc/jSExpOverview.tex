\subsection[title=Overview]

Our \quote{\joylol\ S-Expression Language}, \joylolSExp, is loosely based 
upon the \quote{Eiffel Language} (\cite{meyer1992eiffelTheLanguage} 
Appendix H). 

This JoyLoL S-Expression sublanguage provides a dialect of JoyLoL in which 
to write code fragments in a concatenative programming style. 

In this concatenative style, the programmer only has direct access to the 
\emph{top} of the \emph{data} and \emph{process} stacks. However, each of 
these stacks might \emph{(potentially)} be (non-small) \emph{transfinite} 
Lists of Lists.
