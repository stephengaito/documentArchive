\subsection[title=Overview]

Our \quote{\joylol\ Register Machine Language}, \joylolCoAlg, is loosely 
based upon the \quote{Eiffel Language} (\cite{meyer1992eiffelTheLanguage} 
Appendix H). 

This JoyLoL Register Machine sublangauge provides a dialect of JoyLoL in 
which to write code fragments in an imperative programming style. 

In this register machine style, the programmer has direct access to a 
\emph{small} number of \emph{typed} variables as well as a \emph{small} 
randomly accessible address space of \emph{small} \emph{variables}.
