# Objectives

* Define trans-finite Turing machines
* Show that they are equivalent to Turing's Oracle machines
* Define standard computational classes
 * Reduction

We work with (strongly) inaccessible cardinals since they provide 
closure under the standard manipulation of reduction in computational 
theory. Note that we explicilty allow $\alpha_0$ to be an inaccessible 
cardinal. The classical Turing machine is simply the 
$\alpha_0$-modi-potent Turing machine.
