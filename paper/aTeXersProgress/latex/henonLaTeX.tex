\section{Introduction}

The Henon map is a diffeomorphism of the plane developed by H\'enon to study 
chaotic dynamics. Since the Henon map is a diffeomorphism we should, in 
theory, be able to predict its behaviour for all iterates. In fact almost 
every orbit of the Henon map exhibits sensitive dependence on the initial 
conditions, otherwise known as Chaos. 

The Lozi map is a piece-wise linear map of the plane developed by Lozi to 
study the behaviour of the Henon map. 

The Two-shift is a map of the discrete topological space of either one or two 
sided sequences of two symbols, often taken to be $\{+1, -1\}, \{+, -\}$ or 
$\{0, 1\}$. 

Our ultimate aim is to explore the relationship between these three maps in 
order to gain a better understanding of the structure of the chaotic dynamics 
of the Henon map.
