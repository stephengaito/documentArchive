\startsection[title=Finding out how to do things]

As the \goto{\ConTeXt\ Garden wiki}[url(cGarden)] suggests the best place 
for a \emph{document} writer to begin learning \ConTeXt\ is by reading 
either the \goto{\ConTeXt\ Reference Manual}[url(cRef)] or the 
\goto{\ConTeXt\ Mark IV, an excursion}[url(cExcursion)]\footnote{However, 
the 'Excursions' document linked to from the \ConTeXt\ Garden wiki is 
rather old. The most up to date version can be found in the doc 
subdirectory of any local \goto{Standalone installation}[url(cStandalone)] 
in the directory 
\type{tex/texmf-context/doc/context/documents/general/manuals/ma-cb-en.pdf}} 
document. 

For a \emph{module} writer, the documentation, while copious, is spread 
more widely. Again the best places to start are still the reference and 
excursion manuals. Inside any \goto{Standalone 
installation}[url(cStandalone)] there is a collection of current manuals 
located in the directory 
\type{tex/texmf-context/doc/context/documents/general/manuals}.

\startsubsection[title=Local web-servers]

More importantly are the comments contained in the \ConTeXt\ source code 
it self. Assuming you have installed the \goto{Standalone 
installation}[url(cStandalone)], the \type{mtxrun --script server --auto} 
command will provide a local web-server which can be used, among other 
things, to browse the primary collection of \ConTeXt\ commands, their 
syntax and more importantly the \ConTeXt\ module file which contains the 
command definition. \ConTeXt's core module code is very cleanly written 
and more importantly contains supporting discussion of the intent behind 
the higher level command definitions. All of this code and discussion can 
be easily found using your browser's find in page function. 

This module provides the \type{mtxrun --script xrefs --build} command 
which walks through the code in a local standalone copy of \ConTeXt\ to 
produce a collection of static cross reference web-pages. By default these 
pages are created in the \type{xrefs} directory located beside the main 
\type{tex} directory of your standalone installation. You can use any 
web-server to server these pages. These cross reference web-pages provide 
a simple tool to browse the existing \ConTeXt\ source code, together with 
collections of links to the usage of important commands. These cross 
reference web-pages also provide a way to browse the existing the 
\ConTeXt\ interface definition XML syntax, together with all known 
examples of each XML entity's use. 

To use either of these commands, it is important to remember to 
\type{mtxrun --generate} after any major change to your standalone 
installation. For Unix users, this module has provided, in the \type{bin} 
directory, simple bash scripts which can be used to automate the running 
of these web-servers.

\startsection[title=Providing documentation]

There are two ways to document a given \ConTeXt\ module, by either providing 
documentation embedded in the module definition file, or conversely by 
writing various \ConTeXt\ documents. 

\startsubsection[title=Internal documentation]

The \ConTeXt\ module documentation system makes use of \TeX\ comments 
embedded inside the module definition files to provide literate 
programming style documentation of the macro definitions for any given 
module. 

There are four distinct types of document comments, in each case 

\startitemize

\item Standard \TeX\ comments begin with a \type{%} character and continue 
until the end of the current line of text. Any such comments will be embedded 
into the definitional section of the module documentation. For example:

\starttyping

% begin info
%
% title   : ConTests: Unit testing for \CONTEXT\
% comment : Unit testing for \CONTEXT\ using LunaTest
% status  : under development, mkiv only
%
% end info

\stoptyping

\item In a Copyright section, each line begins with \type{%C} and continues 
to the end of the current line. For example:

The following description of the documentation comments has been taken from 
the \type{mtx-modules.lua} file in the 
\type{<contextInsallation>/tex/texmf-context/scripts/context/lua} directory. 

\starttyping

-- Documentation can be woven into a source file. This script can generates
-- a file with the documentation and source fragments properly tagged. The
-- documentation is included as comment:
--
-- %D ......  some kind of documentation
-- %M ......  macros needed for documenation
-- %S B       begin skipping
-- %S E       end skipping
--
-- The generated file is structured as:
--
-- \starttypen
-- \startmodule[type=suffix]
-- \startdocumentation
-- \stopdocumentation
-- \startdefinition
-- \stopdefinition
-- \stopmodule
-- \stoptypen
--
-- Macro definitions specific to the documentation are not surrounded by
-- start-stop commands. The suffix specification can be overruled at runtime,
-- but defaults to the file extension. This specification can be used for language
-- depended verbatim typesetting.
--
-- In the mkiv variant we filter the \module settings so that we don't have
-- to mess with global document settings.
