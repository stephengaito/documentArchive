# A [Wee Beastie](http://www.robertburns.org/works/75.shtml)'s Guide to Reality: A [Shaggy Dog Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story)

This is an extended abstract outlining my personal attempt to provide a 
mathematically rigorous theory of reality for any finite computational 
being. 

As with any [ShaggyDog 
story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story), this "story" is 
long, complex, with (at first sight) tenuous links, and whose "climax" 
will be (again at first sight) rather underwhelming: our current 
mathematical practice will be _largely_ unchanged. However, as with 
all of mathematics, the "devil is in the detail", it is my hope that the 
subtle shift in our understanding of the deep meaning of mathematics 
will provide perspectives in which, for example, Quantum Gravity becomes 
"obvious".
