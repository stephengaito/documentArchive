# Peer review

## Problem

Current scientific practice is to submit all papers for “peer review”
before the papers are published in reputable journals.  Without the
critical discussion provided by “peer review”, anyone could essentially
publish anything they wanted to “hear” and say that it is “research”.
Peer review provides a critical “brake” on this wishful publishing.

## Goals

Continuous "peer review" of "published documents" is a significant part
of any on-going technical discussion, and as such should be seamlessly
part of the FandianPF system.

## Requirements

> "Published document" "discussions" SHOULD provide ongoing,
> continuous, "peer review".

> It MUST be possible to add "comments" to ANY particular item of content.

> There SHOULD be NO restriction on who may make comments.

## Solution
