# Editorial and copyright policies

## Problem

The contents of any highly public content management system, such as a
FandianPF instance, will be read, copied and used by a very wide range
of users, for a very wide range of uses.

## Goals

Make sure both the editorial and copyright policies are visible to all
users on all pages.

## Requirements

> There MUST be an Editorial policy section detailing current editorial
> policy.

> There MUST be a list of the current Editors.

> There MUST be a Copyright policy section detailing the current
> copyright policy.

> Both the Editorial and Copyright policies MUST be visible on ALL
> pages.

> It MUST be possible for the Editors to alter the Editorial policy
> from time to time.

> It MIGHT be possible to have different Copyright policy for different
> sections of a given FandianPF instance.

> It MIGHT be possible (within legal restrictions) to vary the
> Copyright policy from time to time.
