\section{Introduction} For historical reasons, all current foundations of
Mathematics are based upon first or higher order logic. In order to provide a Computational Foundation of Mathematics we need to answer three primary questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is Mathematics?
	\item What constitues a Foundation of Mathematics?
	\item What is a Computational Process?
\end{itemize}

Again, for historical reasons, Mathematics is currently identified with some
super-set of a formulation of the axioms of the well-founded sets, such as ZFC.
In particular it is assumed that Cantor's collection of Ordinals larger than
$\omega$ and their well-ordering are \emph{required} to provide a credible
formulation of real analysis as required for Mathematical Physics.

While we assert that what is normally considered computation, augmented with
something as powerfull as the Well-Ordering Theorem, can provide a Computational
Foundation for what is currently considered Mathematics, we will argue that
Computational \emph{processes} are more than sufficient to provide foundations
for real analysis. Unfortunately, for \emph{this paper} we will limit ourselves
to showing that the collection of Lists of Lists and Joy processes form a fully
algebraic pair of Topos which contain an \emph{implementation} of the Reals.
