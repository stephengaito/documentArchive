\chapter[title=Base types] 

All data types \emph{must} be allowed to be processes (and hence 
infinite). 

Weak or partial comparability is any comparable process which might not be 
total (and hence might be partial). 

We need the ability to sort lists of lists. Certain aspects of Quantum 
Dynamics will turn out to depend upon the exact properties of processes, 
such as sorting, on lists of lists. 

So it is important that all sorting algorithms are able to deal with 
partial comparability. In particular this means that nearly equal entities 
are \quote{kept close}.
