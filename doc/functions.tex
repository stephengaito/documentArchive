\TODO{Show that from every classically computable function (in Weihrauch's 
sense) we can create a net of simplicial functions which approximate the 
classical real function.} 

\TODO{The imprecise version of the characteristic function of the 
irrationals is the function $f(x) = [0,1]$ ; Note that we are always 
interested in the appoximations from below and (dually) above, but never 
mixed approximations ; The imprecise version the step function is $f(x) = 
0$ for $x < 0$, $f(0) = [0,1]$, and $f(x) = 1$ for $0 < x$. } 

\TODO{show that the \emph{precise} \emph{polynomials} are dense in the 
imprecise functions} 

\TODO{show that the (graphs of) polynomials can be smoothly approximated 
by simpilcial structures with \quote{bounded slope}}
