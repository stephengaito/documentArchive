\chapter[title=A simple \joylol\ implementation]
\startAppendicesBar

In this appendix, we provide a full, but very simple, 
\emph{implementation} of \joylol\ in \joylol\ itself\footnote{There is a 
very long tradition of writing computer languages in themselves, see for 
example the original implementation of Lisp in Lisp, 
\cite{mcCarthyAbrahamsEdwardsHartLevin1965lispManual}.}. We will provide 
full proofs of this implementation's correctness. 

To keep this implementation simple, we use very simple container 
implementations which are unlikely to be performant for large scale use. 
Our companion document, \cite{gaito2017joyLoLImplementation}, provides a 
slighly more performant implementation using the ANSI-C programming 
language wrapped in \Lua\ and loadable into \luaTeX\ (and hence into 
\ConTeXt). It is this implementation, loaded into \ConTeXt, which has been 
used to formally check the correctness of all assertions in \emph{this} 
document.
