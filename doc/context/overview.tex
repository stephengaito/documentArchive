We will provide a full formal description of two diametrically different 
programming languages, JoyLoL and WhileRecLoL. The language WhileRecLoL 
will be in the same overall class of languages as most standard imperative 
programming languages such as, Lua, C, Pascal, Algol, Java, Python, PHP, 
Ruby, etc. Most programmers will recognize WhileRecLoL as a close, but 
simplified, cousin to the languages they are currently using.

The primary importance of JoyLoL on the other hand is that it \emph{is} a 
fixed point of the formal semantics operator. This is why JoyLoL is being 
proposed as a foundation for both computation and more importantly 
Mathematics\footnote{While we assert that JoyLoL provides a 
\emph{computational} foundation for Mathematics, proving this assertion 
will be the work of many (future) papers. We will not even attempt a proof 
in this document.}. 

As developed over the past 50 years, the formal semantics operator has 
three parts: 

\startitemize[n, packed]
\item Denotational Semantics
\item Operational Semantics
\item Axiomatic Semantics
\stopitemize

A good introduction to these three types of formal semantics can be found 
in \cite[winskel1993formalSemanticsProgrammingLanguages, 
gunter1992semainticProgrammingLanguages]
