\chapter[title=Merge Sort]

We are interested in whether or not a process can be sorted. That is, can 
we sort a potentially infinite list? Most implementations of mergeSort, 
assume a finite list. One exception to this is Okasaki's \quote{Bottom-Up 
Mergesort with Sharing} in \cite{okasaki1996funcDataStructures}. However, 
Okasaki's implementation requires an existing list to add its head to a 
sortable collection prior to being sorted. We will sort the list directly.
