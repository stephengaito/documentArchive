Define DictNode:

\starttyping
typedef struct joylol_object_struct {
  JClass    *type;
  TagType    tag;
  FlagsType  flags; // an arbitrary collection of bits
} JObj;

typedef struct dictNode_object_struct {
  JObj         super;
  Symbol      *symbol;
  JObj        *preObs;
  JObj        *value;
  JObj        *postObs;
  DictNodeObj *left;
  DictNodeObj *right;
  DictNodeObj *previous;
  DictNodeObj *next;
  size_t       height;
  long         balance;
} DictNodeObj;
