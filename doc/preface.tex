\chapter[title=Preface]

The programming language, \type{JoyLoL} (the Joy of Lists of Lists), is a 
concatenative language based losely upon Manfred von Thun's programming 
language \type{Joy}, \cite{vonThun1994mathematicalFoundations}, 
\cite{vonThun1994overview}. The JoyLoL language's primary goal is, in its 
most austere form, to be a fixed point of the semantics functor. Being a 
fixed point of the semantic functor, it is its own denotational, 
operational and axiomatic semantics. This means that, in particular, it 
provides a sufficient foundation for both computational theory, as well 
as, in its VopÄ›nka principled form, all of Mathematical discourse.
