See \cite{weihrauch2000computableAnalysis}.

\TODO{Explore Weihrauch's various definitions of the reals (via different 
convergence requirements).} 


\TODO{Describe imprecise reals; Figure out how to detain different 
convergence (upper and lower) rates based upon arbitrary precise functions 
in which the polynomials are dense ; }

\TODO{show the relationship between stated convergence rates and the 
standard algebraic operators on the imprecise reals} 

\TODO{show that $R x R$ can be given a 2-simplicial structure}
