% Preface to the Implementation Part

In this part, we provide a full, but very simple, \emph{implementation} of 
\joylol\ in \joylol\ itself\footnote{There is a very long tradition of 
writing computer languages in themselves, see for example the original 
implementation of Lisp in Lisp, 
\cite{mcCarthyAbrahamsEdwardsHartLevin1965lispManual}, or the very first 
C-compiler for the earliest Unix, \cite{??}.}. We will provide full proofs 
of this implementation's correctness. 

To keep this implementation simple, we use very simple container 
implementations which are unlikely to be performant for large scale use. 
Our companion document, \cite{gaito2017joyLoLImplementation}, provides a 
slighly more performant implementation using the ANSI-C programming 
language wrapped in \Lua\ and loadable into \luaTeX\ (and hence into 
\ConTeXt). It is this implementation, loaded into \ConTeXt, which has been 
used to formally check the correctness of all assertions in \emph{this} 
document.
