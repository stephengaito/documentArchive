\subsection[title=Overview]

Our \quote{\joylol\ Configuration Language}, \joylolCF, is loosely based 
upon the \quote{Language for assembling classes in Eiffel} (Lace) 
(\cite{meyer1992eiffelTheLanguage} Appendix D).

Since a specific \joylol\ artefact is \quote{built} out of a large 
collection of inter-dependent individual \joylol\ CoAlgebras, the primary 
concern of the \joylolCF\ is to specify which particular implementations 
of these CoAlgebras, are to be used in a given \joylol\ artefact.

A system is composed from clusters of CoAlgebras.
