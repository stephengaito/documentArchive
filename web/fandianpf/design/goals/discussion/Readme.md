# Facilitating technical discussion

## Problem

Communicating extended Scientific, Engineering or Mathematical 
(Technical) arguments to an audience with a wide range of skills 
represents a profound challenge.

To fully understand a Technical argument, one requires a *simultaneous* 
comprehension of both the high-level structure: 

 * "where is this argument leading?",
 * "why is the argument important?", 
 * "how can *I* make use of this sort of argument to...?",

as well as the deep technical details.  This is what makes technical 
arguments so difficult to compose as well as to understand.

To help subject experts keep track of the over all, "high-level", 
argument, technical authors make use of a considerable amount of 
"technical jargon".  Words or short phrases which "stand for" complex 
concepts, concepts which have been developed and understood by 
overlapping communities of subject experts, over many years of hard 
personal work.

Some of this technical jargon has explicit definitions. However, most 
of this technical jargon, of necessity, represents more nebulous ideas 
shared amongst researchers in overlapping collections of fields. These 
more nebulous ideas make up the so called "folk lore" of a subject.

A researcher's "job" is to take these nebulous ideas and make them 
"rigorous", "repeatable" and "understood". This task is undertaken by 
conducting extended conversations with both oneself, through time, as 
well as with others, through both space and time.

## Goals

The primary goal of the Fandian Publishing Framework (FandianPF) is to 
facilitate the recording and development of this ongoing (technical) 
conversation across various levels of detail and among users of 
differing levels of skill.

## Requirements

> It MUST be easy to record more or less structured "notes" of various 
> "sizes".

> All "notes" MUST be versioned.

> All "notes" SHOULD be marked with a "level of being done" (private 
> draft, shareable draft, "published").

> It MUST be easy to identify some "notion" of "level" (generality, 
> detail) which a given "note" occupies/addresses.

> It MUST be easy to inter-relate these "notes".

> It MUST be easy to search/navigate this collection of "notes", 
> through time, topic, level of detail, or "relatedness".

> It MUST be easy to navigate from a "note" which uses a technical 
> term, to a brief description of the "definition" of this term, to one 
> or more notes in the "cloud" of other notes which use this term.

> It SHOULD be easy to identify some level of "importance" of a given 
> note in this "cloud" for its contribution to the "definition" of 
> given term.
