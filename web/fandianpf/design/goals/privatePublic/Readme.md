# Linking private work with public discussion

## Problem

The writing and reading of technical ideas is at one and the same time,
both intensely private (we usually write up our ideas hunched over our
preferred writing tools), and intensely public (we spend a great deal of
time talking with one or more colleagues in various (semi-)public
spaces, or, alternatively, reading others ideas/papers).

Our individual writing efforts often happen best while "off the network".

For example, my son, who is studying to be an Ecologist, is currently
spending 2 and a half months doing field research on Ellesmere Island
in the arctic.  "Continuous" network access for him, over the only
satellite phone for miles around, would be prohibitively expensive
($14/minute).

Conversely, we often want to share our work, both drafts and "finished"
copies, with colleagues and/or the general public around the world.

## Goals

The FandianPF should facilitate the inter-working of overlapping
"clouds" of researchers and their "personal" and/or (semi-)"public"
FandianPF systems.  This would facilitate its use in private "off
network" activity, as well as semi-private working groups, as well as
fully public discussions.

## Requirements

> It SHOULD be easy to push and/or pull content from one FandianPF
> system to any other.

> It MUST be possible to control what content is pushed/pulled to/from
> any one system.

> It SHOULD be possible to provide automatic "rules" to help limit this
> flow of "notes"/"documents".
