# Publishing summaries of extended discussion

## Problem

At some point, a researcher will decide that they understand an idea
well enough that they wish to publish an extended discussion/exposition
or argumentation surrounding an idea. It is important that this extended
discussion be identified and read as a "whole". Such an extended
discussion, which of necessity is larger than any FandianPF "note",
represents a more traditionally publishable paper.

## Goals

The technical discussion facilitated by FandianPF should extend
seamlessly into "published documents".

## Requirements

> It MUST be easy to "publish" extended discussions directly on the
> FandianPF system.

> It MUST be easy to search/navigate through this collection of
> "published documents".

> It MUST be easy to inter-relate "notes" with "published documents".

> It MUST be easy to inter-relate different drafts of the "same"
> "published document".

> It MUST be easy to "explode" a "published document" into one or more
> "discussions" (related collections of "notes") on key points
> contained in the "published document".
