# Engendering high quality discussion

## Problem

Allowing anyone to comment opens a researcher and their "surrounding"
community open to all sorts of "spam", and/or, argumentation of
varying degrees of quality or relevance.

## Goals

The management of the quality of on-going discussion should be easy.

## Requirements

> ALL comments MUST only be left by identifiable individuals.

> There MUST be some way to filter spam.

> There SHOULD be some measure of comment "quality".

> There MIGHT be some way to pre-filter comments and assign an initial
> "quality".

> There SHOULD be some way to allow readers to vote on the "quality" of
> a given comment.

> There MIGHT be some way to "grey-out" or "hide" "low quality"
> comments.

> It SHOULD be possible to suspend all voting on the "quality" of a
> given "note" or its associated "comments".

> It SHOULD be possible to suspend all new "comments" on a given
> "note".

## Solution
