\startsection[title=Bootstrapping JoyLoL]

Since we want as rigorous as possible tool set, we ultimately need to use 
JoyLoL to deductively prove its own correctness. Unfortunately, at least 
initially, most users do not have a running version of JoyLoL. In order to 
obtain the \emph{first} running version, we need to \quote{bootstrap} the 
tool set by building an initial version of JoyLoL which is not rigorously 
checked.
