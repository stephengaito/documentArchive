The \TeX\ Directory Structure (TDS) specifies an overall structure for any 
collection of \TeX\ resources. \ConTeXt\ resources naturally fit within this 
overall structure. 

In \ConTeXt\ there are two distinct types of modules, \emph{core} and 
\emph{third-party} modules. In addition \ConTeXt\ has had two major 
generations, \emph{MkII} and \emph{MkIV}, we will only deal with the \LuaTeX\ 
based MkIV generation. 

Third-party MkIV generation modules consist of an interface description, 
written in XML and a number of MkIV and Lua module definition files. 
Third-party modules may also contain additional documention or example files, 
as well as some lua scripts for use with the mtxrun commands. These files are 
all located in the following TDS based file tree: 

\starttyping

t-<moduleName>
  doc
    context
      third
        <moduleName>
          {contains any document files or examples for the module}
  scripts
    context
      lua
        {contains any mtxrun based lua scripts}
  tex
    context
      interface
        t-<moduleName>.xml
      third
        <moduleName>
          {contains any MkIV or Lua definition files for the module}

\stoptyping

Note that all third-party files should begin with the prefix \type{t-}.
