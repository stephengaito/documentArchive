\chapter{Overview}

\startsection[title=Introduction]

\ConTeXt\ is a type setting package based upon Knuth's \TeX\ system. 
ConTeXt is similar to, but in many respects more disciplined internally 
than, \LaTeX. This internal discipline makes it easier to write \ConTeXt\ 
modules. Unfortunately, \ConTeXt's current documentation, while copious, 
can be patchy and if more focused upon document writers than module 
builders. This is likely the result of \ConTeXt's continual development. 

This document is an attempt to provide a consistent overview of the 
documentation required to write a working \ConTeXt\ module. At the moment, 
this overview consists of a collection of notes to myself. You are welcome to 
use these notes, however they are in no way complete or `official'. 

The objective of this document is to explore how to use \ConTeXt's various 
macros to write a \ConTeXt\ module. We do this by documenting the process 
used to create a number of modules. The first of which is ConTests, a module 
to provide Test Driven Development within a \ConTeXt\ and \LuaTeX\ 
environment.
