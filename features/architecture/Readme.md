# FandianPF (integration) architecture

## Problem: Agile open source development

I need to keep the development of this project simple, lightweight and 
fast.

### Goals

The source code should be open and of continuous high quality.

The project should be developed using Behaviour Driven Development techniques.

#### Requirements

> The source code for the FandianPF system WILL be accessible via GitHub.

> The source code for the FandianPF system WILL be given a non-copyleft 
> open source License.

> The source code WILL be tested using a Continuous Integration server 
> (Travis?).

> The dependencies WILL be tracked using ....

> The code quality WILL be measured using ...

> Integration features WILL be specified and acceptance tested using 
> Cucumber.

> Unit specifications WILL be captured and tested using RSpec.

> Development WILL progress in short "sprints" (of a week or so).

> Each sprint WILL develop a small number of related (Cucumber 
> specified) features.
