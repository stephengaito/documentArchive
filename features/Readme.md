# FandianPF high-level goals

## Problem

Communicating extended Scientific, Engineering or Mathematical 
(Technical) arguments to an audience with a wide range of skills 
represents a profound challenge.

To fully understand a Technical argument, one requires a *simultaneous* 
comprehension of both the high-level structure: 

 * "where is this argument leading?",
 * "why is the argument important?", 
 * "how can *I* make use of this sort of argument to...?",

as well as the deep technical details.  This is what makes technical 
arguments so difficult to compose as well as to understand.

To help subject experts keep track of the over all, "high-level", 
argument, technical authors make use of a considerable amount of 
"technical jargon".  Words or short phrases which "stand for" complex 
concepts, concepts which have been developed and understood by 
overlapping communities of subject experts, over many years of hard 
personal work.

Some of this technical jargon has explicit definitions. However, most 
of this technical jargon, of necessity, represents more nebulous ideas 
shared amongst researchers in overlapping collections of fields. These 
more nebulous ideas make up the so called "folk lore" of a subject.

A researcher's "job" is to take these nebulous ideas and make them 
"rigorous", "repeatable" and "understood". This task is undertaken by 
conducting extended conversations with both oneself, through time, as 
well as with others, through both space and time.

### Goal

The primary goal of the Fandian Publishing Framework (FandianPF) is to 
facilitate the recording and development of this ongoing (technical) 
conversation across various levels of detail and among users of 
differing levels of skill.

#### Requirements

> It MUST be easy to record more or less structured "notes" of various 
> "sizes".

> All "notes" MUST be versioned.

> All "notes" SHOULD be marked with a "level of being done" (private 
> draft, shareable draft, "published").

> It MUST be easy to identify some "notion" of "level" (generality, 
> detail) which a given "note" occupies/addresses.

> It MUST be easy to inter-relate these "notes".

> It MUST be easy to search/navigate this collection of "notes", 
> through time, topic, level of detail, or "relatedness".

> It MUST be easy to navigate from a "note" which uses a technical 
> term, to a brief description of the "definition" of this term, to one 
> or more notes in the "cloud" of other notes which use this term.

> It SHOULD be easy to identify some level of "importance" of a given 
> note in this "cloud" for its contribution to the "definition" of 
> given term.

## Problem

At some point, a researcher will decide that they understand an idea 
well enough that they wish to publish an extended discussion/exposition 
or argumentation surrounding an idea. It is important that this extended 
discussion be identified and read as a "whole". Such an extended 
discussion, which of necessity is larger than any FandianPF "note", 
represents a more traditionally publishable paper.

### Goal

The technical discussion facilitated by FandianPF should extend 
seamlessly into "published documents".

#### Requirements

> It MUST be easy to "publish" extended discussions directly on the 
> FandianPF system.

> It MUST be easy to search/navigate through this collection of 
> "published documents".

> It MUST be easy to inter-relate "notes" with "published documents".

> It MUST be easy to inter-relate different drafts of the "same" 
> "published document".

> It MUST be easy to "explode" a "published document" into one or more 
> "discussions" (related collections of "notes") on key points 
> contained in the "published document".

## Problem

Current scientific practice is to submit all papers for “peer review” 
before the papers are published in reputable journals.  Without the 
critical discussion provided by “peer review”, anyone could essentially 
publish anything they wanted to “hear” and say that it is “research”. 
Peer review provides a critical “brake” on this wishful publishing.

### Goal

Continuous "peer review" of "published documents" is a significant part 
of any on-going technical discussion, and as such should be seamlessly 
part of the FandianPF system.

#### Requirements

> "Published document" "discussions" SHOULD provide ongoing, 
> continuous, "peer review".

> It MUST be possible to add "comments" to ANY particular item of content.

> There SHOULD be NO restriction on who may make comments.

## Problem

Allowing anyone to comment opens a researcher and their "surrounding" 
community open to all sorts of "spam", and/or, argumentation of 
varying degrees of quality or relevance.

### Goal

The management of the quality of on-going discussion should be easy.

#### Requirements

> ALL comments MUST only be left by identifiable individuals.

> There MUST be some way to filter spam.

> There SHOULD be some measure of comment "quality".

> There MIGHT be some way to pre-filter comments and assign an initial 
> "quality".

> There SHOULD be some way to allow readers to vote on the "quality" of 
> a given comment.

> There MIGHT be some way to "grey-out" or "hide" "low quality" 
> comments.

> It SHOULD be possible to suspend all voting on the "quality" of a 
> given "note" or its associated "comments".

> It SHOULD be possible to suspend all new "comments" on a given 
> "note".

> There SHOULD be different levels of "users" consisting (but not 
> necessarily limited to): "Administrators", "Editors", "Authors", 
> "Readers" ("Spammers"?). These different "users" WILL have differing 
> levels of access to access or alter content or otherwise control the 
> contents of the system.

## Problem

The writing and reading of technical ideas is at one and the same time, 
both intensely private (we usually write up our ideas hunched over our 
preferred writing tools), and intensely public (we spend a great deal of 
time talking with one or more colleagues in various (semi-)public 
spaces, or, alternatively, reading others ideas/papers).

Our individual writing efforts often happen best while "off the network". 

For example, my son, who is studying to be an Ecologist, is currently 
spending 2 and a half months doing field research on Ellesmere Island 
in the arctic.  "Continuous" network access for him, over the only 
satellite phone for miles around, would be prohibitively expensive 
($14/minute).

Conversely, we often want to share our work, both drafts and "finished" 
copies, with colleagues and/or the general public around the world.

### Goal

The FandianPF should facilitate the inter-working of overlapping 
"clouds" of researchers and their "personal" and/or (semi-)"public" 
FandianPF systems.  This would facilitate its use in private "off 
network" activity, as well as semi-private working groups, as well as 
fully public discussions.

#### Requirements

> It SHOULD be easy to push and/or pull content from one FandianPF 
> system to any other.

> It MUST be possible to control what content is pushed/pulled to/from 
> any one system.

> It SHOULD be possible to provide automatic "rules" to help limit this 
> flow of "notes"/"documents".

## Problem

The FandianPF system will never "exist" on its own. There are numerous 
research tools with which it would be useful for a given researcher's 
FandianPF system to inter-operate.  

For example many researchers collect references and papers using the 
Zotero system.

Similarly many researchers use an external reference system such as 
BibTeX files, or a structured reference management system such as 
Docear.

Docear is built on the Freeplane mind mapping tool. The ability to 
process a mind map into a collection of "notes" would be useful.

Many researchers will have existing external (time-series) data 
collection, storage and analysis tools. However they might want to 
store some or all of their data in FandianPF to facilitate collection 
(while in the field) and/or discussion of the data.

### Goal

It is critical that it be easy to build interface tools for researchers 
to access the content they have in the FandianPF system using "other" 
tools.

#### Requirements

> The FandianPF system MUST provide RESTful interfaces.

> Access to these RESTful interfaces MUST be via OAuth authentication.

> It SHOULD be possible to secure the transfer of content via any 
> RESTful interface using SSL/TSL/SSH.

## Problem

Of necessity, technical discussions often make use of mathematical 
arguments, equations and symbols. While there are a few exceptional 
tools, it is still, in June 2013, very difficult to write short "bits" 
of mathematical content on or for the "Web".

Most current tools for putting mathematical symbols on the web, so 
seriously interrupt the flow of thought to the point that it is, by and 
large, "not worth bothering" writing mathematics on the web.

This lack of good mathematical content on the web seriously inhibits 
the understanding of the general public about mathematics and its 
associated subjects.

Similarly, diagrams are often beneficial in providing a visual tool to 
help orient a technical discussion.  Again it is critically important 
that creating these diagrams, should not interrupt the flow of thought 
in writing about the technical subject.

The use of an "external" diagramming tool for "simple" diagrams, both 
interrupts the flow of thought *and* (potentially) creates a very 
disjointed collection of artefacts.  Ideally "simple" diagrams should 
be "drawn" using "textual" instructions which can be directly embedded 
in a given "note".

### Goal

Writing new (mathematical) content in FandianPF should be as easy as 
using LaTeX.

#### Requirements

> The FandianPF system MUST provide a TeX/LaTeX filter to transcribe 
> (simple) TeX/LaTeX macros into MathJAX or MathML content.

> The FandianPF system MUST provide a set of simple textural macros 
> which can expand into SVG content.

> It should be possible to reuse "diagrams" in multiple "notes" if 
> desired.

> The FandianPF system MUST provide a simple textural "markup" system 
> (such as Markdown or Creole).

> The FandianPF system MIGHT provide a WYSIWYG editor.  

> Any such WYSIWYG editor MUST not interfere with the use of textural 
> macros or other markup.
