\section[title=Goals]

We develop a \joylol\ Parsing Expression Grammar (jPeg) modelled upon the 
virtual machine implementation of the Lua Parsing Expression Grammar 
(LPeg). The Lua version upon which we base our implementation can be found 
in \cite{ierusalimschy2008lpegArticle} and 
\cite{medeirosIerusalimschy2008parsingMachinePEGs}. Particularly important 
for our work are the extensive correctness proofs provided by 
\cite{medeirosIerusalimschy2008parsingMachinePEGs}. 

An important difference is that while LPeg's implementation is based upon 
an interpreter specific to the LPeg virtual machine code, we will use 
\joylol's interpreter directly. The backtracking stack used by LPeg is 
replaced by a careful use of \joylol's process stack. By implementing jPeg 
directly in \joylol, jPeg programs will benefit from any optimizations 
provided by the \joylol\ compiler.
