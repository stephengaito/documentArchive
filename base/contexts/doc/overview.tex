JoyLoL Contexts form the kernel of the trampolined interpreter for JoyLoL. 

A Context consists of the data and process stacks organized as two lists 
of lists. The evaluation or interpretation of JoyLoL in the context of a 
Context consists of taking the top item off the process stack and 
\quote{performing} it. \quote{Performing} a given JoyLoL word, will result 
in changes being made to both the data and process stacks. A Context is 
interpreted in an eval loop, until there are no more JoyLoL words on the 
process stack. 

{\bf Question}: are threads (POSIX-threads/native-threads) identified with 
contexts? Or are contexts the equivalent of \quote{green threads} (i.e. 
\quote{threads} emulated by JoyLoL rather than identified with the 
underlying Operating System's threads)? If contexts are not identified 
with POSIX-threads then we will need to mutex contexts (green threads) as 
\quote{data} structures, since it will be possible for multiple running 
threads to alter the same context (as a data structure). If contexts are 
identified with POSIX-threads, then there is no sense to our previous 
(joyLoL20170316) commands to \quote{switch contexts}.
