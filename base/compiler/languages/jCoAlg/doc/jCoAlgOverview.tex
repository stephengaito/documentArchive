\subsection[title=Overview]

Our \quote{\joylol\ CoAlgebra Language}, \joylolCoAlg, is loosely based 
upon the \quote{Eiffel Language} (\cite{meyer1992eiffelTheLanguage} 
Appendix H). 

This CoAlgeba language defines the CoAlgebraic structures which "contain" 
all of the other sublanguages. This CoAlgebra language takes care of the 
explicit definition of the "global" properties of a CoAlgebra such as 
inheritance, invariants, as well as the structure of the creation and 
feature methods.
