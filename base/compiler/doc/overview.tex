\section[title=Overview]

The \joylol\ compiler/interpreter is a fairly standard multi-component 
compiler. However instead of compiling to machine code, it actually 
transpiles core functions to ANSI-C and interprets non-core functions by 
calling the core functions in an appropriately \joylol\ determined order. 

In particular the fairly standard \quote{front-end} is composed by a 
lexer, parser pair. Both the lexer and parser will use a push down 
automata composed by a \joylol\ Parsing Expression Grammar, jPeg. Using a 
push down automata means that, technically, the lexer is powerful enough 
to directly parse \joylol\ code. We use a standard lexer, parser pair to 
allow the lexer and parser's grammars to be kept simpler, both to 
understand as well as to be more performant.
