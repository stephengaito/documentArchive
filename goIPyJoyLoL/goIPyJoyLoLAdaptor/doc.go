/*

The goIPyJoyLoLAdaptor provides the interface from the goIPyKernel (part 
of the goIPythonKernelToolkit) and the cJoyLoL runtime instance of JoyLoL.

Some of the folowing GoDoc documentation, such as the `Dir`, as well as 
the `FSXXX` functions, come from our use of Matt Jibson's esc tool 
(https://github.com/mjibson/esc) to embed the IPyJoyLoL.joy code directly 
into the IPyJoyLoL kernel executable itself.
