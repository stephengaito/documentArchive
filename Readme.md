# Modi-Potent Turing machines

## Overview

To be able to provide a mathematical theory of Reality, one must first 
address the question: *How "Real" is Mathematics?*

Any discussion of the "Reality" or "Validity" of Mathematics is 
essentially a discussion of the *Foundations of Mathematics*.

In this initial cycle of papers we provide a Computational Foundation for
Mathematics. In order to do this while still capturing the whole of 
"classical" mathematics, we need to define more powerful Turing machines.

The "classical" way of extending the power of Turing machine is to use 
oracles. We will instead base our definition of "power" of the Turing machine
on the size of the maximal ordinal used by the Turing machine.
