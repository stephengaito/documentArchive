# Racket Joy

A (partial) implementation of [Manfred von Thun's Joy programming 
language](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language) 
in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)

## Rational

My primary aim is to gain a deeper understanding of a simple example of 
a [Concatenative programming 
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language), 
with a view to evolving it into a foundation for Mathematics (called 
diSimp).

As such I have no interest in implementing all of Joy's "atomic 
programs", only the smallest subset which makes Joy an extensible Turing 
complete langauge.

## The Joy programming language

The [Joy programming 
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)) was a 
[project](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language) 
of [Manfred von 
Thun](https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Manfred%20von%20Thun) at [La 
Trobe University in 
Australia](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/politics-and-philosophy).

["A conversation with Manfred von 
Thun"](http://www.nsl.com/papers/interview.htm) provides an excellent 
brief history of the ideas behind the creation of Joy.

Mirrors of Manfred von Thun's papers outlining Joy can be found at:

* [La 
Trobe](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language)

* [Kevin 
Albrecht](http://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/joy.html)

* [XIE YuHeng](https://github.com/xieyuheng/joy)

Joy is a [concatenative programming 
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language). 

More information on concatenative programming languages can be found on 
the [concatenative.org website](http://www.concatenative.org).
