  abstract = {Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general
ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations,
this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural
transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors,
which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis
of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a
means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical
concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters,
which include many applications of the basic existence theorem
for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed
from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem.
After considering a variety of applications, the book continues
with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This
second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including
two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric
monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence
theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher
dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence.
The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many
other recent advances concerning categories.

x(u) to each (r + 1)-element subset u of {0, 1,..., m} such that
the source and target (r???1)-cells of x(u) are appropriate composites
of x(v) for v a proper subset of u. As m increases, the appropriate
composites quickly become hard to write down. This paper constructs
anm-categoryOm such that anm-functor x:Om ???A is precisely an
m-simplex in A. This leads to a simplicial set ??A, called the
nerve of A, and provides the basis for cohomology with coefficients
in A. Higher order equivalences in A as well as freen-categories
are carefully defined. Each Om is free.

  title = {Weak omega-categories},

  year = {2003},
  abstract = {This paper proposes to define a weak higher-dimensional category
to be a simplicial set satisfying properties. The definition is
a refinement of that suggested at the end of [St3] which required
extra structure on the simplicial set. The paper [St3] constructed
the simplicial nerve of a (strict) ??-category. The principal aim
of the paper was to prove1 that the construction was right adjoint
to the functor which assigned, to the n-simplex, the free n-category
thereon (called the n-th oriental). However, I also provided emperical
evidence for a precise conjecture characterizing nerves of ??-
categories. Roberts [Rs] had distinguished certain simplicial sets
with extra structure that h e called complicial sets. Verity and
I have been using the adjective stratified for a simplicial set
with certain elements distinguished, and called t h i n2, such
that no elements of dimension 0 are thin and all degenerate elements
are thin. For nerves of strict ??-categories, the thin elements
of the nerve are the \"commutative simplexes\". Without actually
having defined the nerve, Roberts achievement was to recognize
which unique horn filler conditions might possibly characterize
a stratified simplicial set as isomorphic to the nerve of an ??-category:
Roberts' conjecture was that his category of complicial sets was
equivalent to the category of ??-categories.

by Ross Street in his 1987 paper on oriented simplices. The resulting
theory of weak complicial sets provides a common generalisation
of the theories of (strict) omega-categories, Kan complexes and
Joyal's quasi-categories. We generalise a number of results due
to the current author with regard to complicial sets and strict
omega-categories to provide an armoury of well behaved technical
devices, such as joins and Gray tensor products, which will be
used to study these the weak omega-category theory of these structures
in a series of companion papers. In particular, we establish their
basic homotopy theory by constructing a Quillen model structure
on the category of stratified simplicial sets whose fibrant objects
are the weak complicial sets. As a simple corollary of this work
we provide an independent construction of Joyal's model structure
on simplicial sets for which the fibrant objects are the quasi-categories.

weak omega-categories, by studying categories which are enriched
in weak complicial sets. These complicial Gray-categories generalise
both the Kan complex enriched categories of homotopy theory and
the Gray-categories of weak 3-category theory. We derive a simplicial
nerve construction, which is closely related to Cordier and Porter's
homotopy coherent nerve, and show that this faithfully represents
complicial Gray-categories as weak complicial sets. The category
of weak complicial sets may itself be canonically enriched to a
complicial Gray-category whose homsets are higher generalisations
of the bicategory of homomorphisms, strong transformations and
modifications. By applying our nerve construction to this structure,
we demonstrate that the totality of all (small) weak complicial
sets and their structural morphisms at higher dimensions form a
richly structured (large) weak complicial set.
